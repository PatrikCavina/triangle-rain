# Triangle Rain

I created this project some time ago when I was feeling inspired and had some free time.
This project produces a shower of inverse triangles in pure vanilla JS.

You can customize the number of triangles/particles directly from the code. The code should be readable enough, but if it's not, feel free to ask questions, submit pull requests, or whatever you prefer ðŸ˜¸.

## Instructions

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Enjoy! ðŸ‘¾
