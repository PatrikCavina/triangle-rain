# Triangle Rain

I created this project a while back when I was feeling inspired and had some free time. This repository represents, in my opinion, a small piece of digital art.

You can customize the number of triangles/particles directly from the code. The code should be readable enough, but if it's not, feel free to ask questions, submit pull requests, or whatever you prefer ðŸ˜¸.

## Instructions

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Enjoy! ðŸ‘¾
